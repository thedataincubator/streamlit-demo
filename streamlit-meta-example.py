That's right, you can write Markdown in Streamlit by calling `st.markdown(text)`. I like to do this and write chunks of text with multi-line strings. 
Some things to note:
* As usual, you need two newlines separating paragraphs.
  * This means you can use a single newline to wrap your text without breaking the paragraph.
  That's kind of nice if your IDE doesn't have a line wrapping option. 
* We can put Markdown in the sidebar, too.
  * Try something like `st.sidebar.markdown("""* Ah, yes... bullet points""")`
* By default, `st.markdown` won't render html. 
  * You can change this by adding the argument `unsafe_allow_html=True`.
* If you have lots of text, it might get unwieldy to write it all in one file. You might consider writing Markdown in separate files and importing it. Maybe that would look something like this:''')

Streamlit is made to render lots of Python objects such as Pandas DataFrames. Let's create a simple DataFrame and render it.

If your app makes any slow computations, this can result in inefficient performance. One major speedup: put the decorator `@st.cache` above all function definitions. This will cache the results of function calls and reload them instead of running the function again. This is particularly useful if you load a large data file or make an API call. For example, you may use something like:
  
  ```python
@st.cache
def load_df_from_url(url):
  df = pd.read_csv(url)

  # Altair in Streamlit
  st.markdown("""## Altair
As you might expect, it's easy to use Streamlit with plotting libraries. Let's run a quick example using Altair. 

Let's also create some `selectbox` selectors to modify our chart encoding. Just for fun, let's make some columns here. 

Streamlit lets use create content in columns using `st.beta_columns`, which takes a tuple of relative column widths as arguments. In other words,
we can write something like this to create 2 columns, with the right-hand column twice as wide as the left.

```python

left_col, right_col = st.beta_columns((1, 2))

with left_col:
  st.write("stuff goes here")
with right_col:
  st.write("stuff also goes here")

```
We then place content in these columns using a *context manager* like the one we saw for the expander.

  left_col, right_col = st.beta_columns((2, 1))

    st.markdown("""
* Nothing to see here, folks, just some text to fill space
* Oh no, everything is overlapping...
      """)


  with left_col:

If you look at the code, I defined the selector values in the left column,
 but I defined the charts in the right column. I didn't have to do it this way, but it's a good example.
 To make this work, I had to reference the left column twice. The whole block looks like this:

 ```python
